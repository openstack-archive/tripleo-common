    description: >-
        Send a message to a Zaqar queue and optionally persist it to Swift

        This workflow sends a standard message to Zaqar (taking care of the
        error handling and retry logic) and optionally persists the message
        to Swift. The output of the workflow directly matches the input, this
        means it can be used to send a message and set the output of the parent
        calling workflow.

        If plan_name is provided the message will be persisted to Swift. In a
        container named "{plan_name}-messages". The swift objects will be named:

            {TYPE}/{TIMESTAMP}.yaml

        If a deployment_status is provided, the top-level deployment_status.yaml
        will also be updated, which will contain the deployment_status and the
        related message.

        The standard message format will be::

            body: {
              type: 'tripleo.workflow.name', # Matches the workflow name
              payload: {
                status: 'STATUS', # One of RUNNING, SUCCESS, FAILED
                execution: {execution details}, # Deprecated and will be removed in the future.
                execution_id: 'UUID',
                message: "Human readable description",
                < Arbitrary data. This should match the workflow output data >
              }
            }

        Workflow Input:
          queue_name - The Zaqar queue name to post to.
          type - The message type, this should match the calling workflows name
          execution - Details about the workflow execution. Should be passed by using <% execution() %>
          status - Optional. The status of the message. SUCCESS/RUNNING/FAILED.
          message - Optional. A human readable message to be included
          payload - Optional. A dictionary output data to be sent in the message.
          plan_name - Optional. The deployment plan name. This is used for the swift messages container.
          deployment_status - Optional. If set the top-level deployment_status.yaml will be updated.
