    console=tty0 has been removed from the kernel arguments for overcloud
    nodes, this means that kernel boot messages will no longer be logged to the
    graphics display. They are still logged to the serial console ttyS0. This
    change is required to avoid performance degradation caused by some graphics
    devices.
