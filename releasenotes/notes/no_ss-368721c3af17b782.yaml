features:
  - |
    This patch moves away from "ss" execs, using lsof instead. This allows
    to drop most of the piping and subshells, making things stronger.
  - |
    Introduce new HEALTHCHECK_DEBUG variable in order to toggle verbosity,
    defaults to 0 (no verbosity). Setting it to 1 will activate -x flag,
    among other things.
  - |
    Push some verbose output to a third descriptor, visible only if we set
    the healthcheck to debug.
