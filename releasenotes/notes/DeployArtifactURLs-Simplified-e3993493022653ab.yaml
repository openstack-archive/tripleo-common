deprecations:
  - The DeployArtifactURL(s) server is no longer makes any use of Swift when
    using built-in scripts to upload artifacts. The old
    `upload-swift-artifacts` file is now a symlink pointed to the updated
    `upload-artifacts` script. While the file has changed, the API remains the
    same. The symlink will ensure that legacy automation remains functional
    while moving over to the new script. The symlink will be removed in a
    future release.
