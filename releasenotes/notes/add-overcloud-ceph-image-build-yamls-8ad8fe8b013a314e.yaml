    Added `overcloud-images-ceph.yaml`, `overcloud-images-ceph-centos8.yaml`,
    and `overcloud-images-ceph-rhel8.yaml` to allow an operator to build an
    image that can be used for dedicated ceph nodes. This `overcloud-ceph`
    image would not have the openstack client, ha or openvswitch related
    packages.
