    Split off Ceph related container images

    This change releases an update on the default tripleo_containers jinja
    template, splitting off the Ceph related container images.
    With this new approach pulling the ceph containers is optional, and can
    be avoided by setting the `ceph_images` boolean to False.
    e.g., passing something like the following::


      parameter_defaults:
        ContainerImagePrepare:
        -   push_destination: true
            set:
                name_prefix: openstack-
                name_suffix: ''
                namespace: quay.io/tripleomaster
                neutron_driver: ovn
                rhel_containers: false
                tag: current-tripleo
                ceph_images: false
        ContainerImagePrepareDebug: true
        ContainerImageRegistryCredentials: {}

    avoid the ceph containers being pulled in the undercloud.
    To make this possible, a new jinja template processing approach
    has been introduced, and a template basedir parameter (required
    by the jinja loader) has been added to the BaseImageManager.
