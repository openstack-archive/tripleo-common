removal:

    Support of Tempest container is removed in favor of os_tempest
    ansible role.
    As it is no longer tested by the CI team and not used anywhere.
    Since tempest is a standalone OpenStack validation tool, can be
    used via installing through rpm package, which is fully supported.
