    The scripts `tripleo-mount-image` and `tripleo-unmount-image` will mount
    the contents of an overcloud image file using qemu-nbd, making it available
    for chroot, or other read/write image operations. The scripts handle
    partition image (overcloud-full.qcow2) as well as the whole-disk image
    (overcloud-hardened-uefi-full.qcow2) with its multiple LVM volume mount
    points.
