    The qemu user on the host gets created using uid/gid 107. Certificates
    on the host, but also the vhost-user sockets created by ovs use this
    uid/gid. With the move to TCIB images the default kolla ids were
    reverted and the previous overwrite dropped. This make e.g. the qemu
    processes to fail to use the libvirt-vnc bind mounted certificates.
    This change brings back the previous overwrite of the qemu user
    uid/gid.
