    Fix `bug 1887692 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1887692>`__ so
    limit_hosts will take precedence over the blacklisted_hostnames.
    And therefore Ansible won't be run with two --limit if both limit hosts
    and blacklisted hostnames are in use. When we want to run Ansible on
    specific hosts, we will ignore the blacklisted nodes and assume we know
    what we do. In the case of the scale-down scenario, the unreachable nodes
    are ignored.
