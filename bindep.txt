# This file facilitates OpenStack-CI package installation
# before the execution of any tests.

# See the following for details:

# Even if the role does not make use of this facility, it
# is better to have this file empty, otherwise OpenStack-CI
# will fall back to installing its default packages which
# will potentially be detrimental to the tests executed.
