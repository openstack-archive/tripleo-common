# The idea here is a container service adds their UID to the kolla group
# via usermod -a -G kolla <uid>.  Then the kolla_start may run
# kolla_set_configs via sudo as the root user which is necessary to protect
# the immutability of the container

# anyone in the kolla group may sudo -E (set the environment)
Defaults: %kolla setenv

# root may run any commands via sudo as the network seervice user.  This is
# neededfor database migrations of existing services which have not been
# converted to run as a non-root user, but instead do that via sudo -E glance
root ALL=(ALL) ALL

# anyone in the kolla group may run /usr/local/bin/kolla_set_configs as the
# root user via sudo without password confirmation
%kolla ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/kolla*
